                <h2>Turntables</h2>
                <p>It is one thing to collect vinyls, but what about actually playing them? You can't without
                    a turntable.
                    What turntable should you buy? Well that depends on your price range and your specific needs.
                    There are some high end turntables
                    that can do just about anything you need them to do and there are some cheap turntables that just get the
                    job done. <br>Below we suggest would be a handy table
                    that might just help you decide which turntable is right for you.
