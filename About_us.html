                <p>It's one thing to give advice on how to care for your records and what turntables to buy, but how do you know if I am a trusted source? 
                   I have been collecting records for about two years and I have a collection of over 51 vinyls, valued at about â‚¬1,242.
                    I have a pioneer DJ PLX-500-K turntable and I have attended numerous record fairs and music gatherings. No expert by any means,
                    but I do have knowledge I would like to share and hey, if your still reading this, I must be doing a pretty good job!
